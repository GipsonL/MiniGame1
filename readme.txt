Description: A Project I completed for Dr. Heisterkamp's CS 4173 video game development course at Oklahoma State University. It is based on the Data persistance repo mission at 
		 https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/submission-data-persistence-in-a-new-repo#.

Known Bugs: Sometimes the ball bounces vertically forever, even though the base project, i.e the project provided by unity, has code in place to stop this. 
		Sometimes, the input box for the user to enter their name feels like it can't be clicked on. I haven't been able to figure out why this happens. 

Creative feature: The second level contains a timer that counts down. The player has a minute to beat the level, or it is game over. However, at the end of the game, even if they lose, they gain something for the more intense version 
	of the game. The player's end score is multiplied by the amount of time the player has left, encouraging them to play efficiently. I also made the ball "speed up" every 15 seconds to keep players on their toes.
